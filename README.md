# Mystery-Word
My second C++ project. A 2 players game where you have to find a word from a shaked one.

## Functions

- [x] Time-to-find counter
- [x] Each time random shake word generator
- [x] Possibility to start a new game at each end of the game

### Maintenance
The executable may not be same than the code written in main.cpp as I edit it directly with GitHub.
